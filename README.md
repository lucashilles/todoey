This repo started as an exercise from the [The Complete 2020 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/), after that I decided to made the app fully functional with my personal touch as a way to study and get better at making flutter apps.

The main objective of this app is to make possible to take short notes and store them, this was the baseline to all other features.
